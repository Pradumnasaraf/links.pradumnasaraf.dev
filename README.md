## [links.pradumnasaraf.dev](https://links.pradumnasaraf.dev/)

This repository is created to host a website, [links.pradumnasaraf.dev](https://links.pradumnasaraf.dev/), which redirects to [biodrop.io/pradumnasaraf](https://biodrop.io/pradumnasaraf). It serves as a collection of all my social media profiles and other links. The reason for choosing this approach over a URL forwarding is to enable Google Analytics for tracking traffic sources. While BioDrop does provide analytics, but I was unable to integrate it with Google Analytics, with my current campaigns and tracking.
