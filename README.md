This repository is created to host a website, [links.pradumnasaraf.dev](https://links.pradumnasaraf.dev/), which redirects to [bio.link/pradumnasaraf](https://bio.link/pradumnasaraf). It serves as a collection of all my social media profiles and other links. The reason for choosing this approach over a URL forwarding is to enable Google Analytics for tracking traffic sources.
